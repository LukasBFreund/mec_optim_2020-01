    "\n",
    "During World War II, engineers in US Army were wondering how to feed their personnel at minimal cost, leading to what is now called the **optimal diet problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nutritionists have identified a number of vital nutrients (calories, protein, calcium, iron, etc.) that matter for a person's health, and have determined the minimum daily intake of each nutrient\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each basic food (pasta, butter, bread, etc), nutritionists have characterized the intake in each of the various nutrients\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each food has a unit cost, and the problem is to find the optimal diet = combination of foods that meet the minimal intake in each of the nutrients and achieves minimal cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was taken on by G. Stigler, who published a paper about it in 1945, giving a first heuristic solution, exhibiting a diet that costs $\\$39.93$ per year in $1939$ dollars. Later (in $1947$) it was one of the first\n",
    "application of G.B. Dantzig's method (the simplex algorithm), which provided the exact solution ($\\$39.67$). It then took $120$ man-day to perform this operation. However today the computer will perform it for us in a\n",
    "fraction of second.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, don't try this diet at home! Dantzig did so and almost died from it...\n",
